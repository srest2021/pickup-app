# Pickup!

> Our app allows users to organize, find, and join pick-up games in a convenient and streamlined manner. Users have access to nearby games that fit their skill level and match the desired sport, while organizers can share and coordinate games with their friends or anyone nearby. Organizers can control game visibility (public vs. private), accept or reject user requests to join a game, and invite specific users to join, allowing full control over who has access to the game location and details. Organizers can coordinate user responsibilities for bringing gear, equipment, and more. Users can add friends and communicate easily with each other through game-specific chatrooms.

## Installing / Getting started

> A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get the app up & running on a local computer. For example, your advisor might use the instruction here to run the application locally.

1. Make sure you have these prerequisites installed: [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/).  

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the root folder in the terminal.

3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

4. To use the Expo Go app: 

    a. Download the Expo Go app on your phone.

    b. Run `npx expo start --go`.
    
    c. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app (Android) or the Camera app (iOS) and open the link.

5. To locally build the project:

    a. On iOS, to run the simulator on Xcode:

    `expo prebuild --platform ios`

    `npx expo run:ios`

    b. On Android (not tested yet):

    `expo prebuild --platform android`

    `npx expo run:android`

## Developing

> Detailed and step-by-step documentation for setting up local development. For example, a new team member will use these instructions to start developing the project further. 

> You should include what is needed (e.g. all of the configurations) to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools (include download links), explaining what database (and version) has been used, etc. If there is any virtual environment, local server, ..., explain here. 

> Additionally, describe and show how to run the tests, explain your code style and show how to check it.
